# 🚀 GitHub Setup Guide - Publish Your Regrowx Project

## 📋 Quick Setup Commands

Run these commands in your terminal to publish your project:

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "🚀 Initial commit: Regrowx - AI-powered African hair care platform"
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "New Repository" (green button)
3. Repository name: `regrowx-naturals`
4. Description: `AI-powered hair care platform combining traditional Ghanaian wisdom with modern technology`
5. Make it **Public** (for hackathon visibility)
6. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create Repository"

### Step 3: Connect and Push to GitHub
```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/regrowx-naturals.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🎯 Alternative: GitHub CLI (Faster)

git add .
git commit -m "🚀 Initial commit: Regrowx - AI-powered African hair care platform"

# Create GitHub repo and push
gh repo create regrowx-naturals --public --push --source=.
