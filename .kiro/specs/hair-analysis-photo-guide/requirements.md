# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Hair Analysis Photo Guide feature enhances the existing Regrowx hair analysis system by providing users with clear visual examples and instructions for taking proper front-view photos. This feature addresses the common issue of poor quality or incorrectly positioned photos that can lead to inaccurate AI analysis results. By showing users exactly what good photos look like and providing real-time guidance during the photo capture process, we can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of hair analysis results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user preparing to take photos for hair analysis, I want to see example images of proper front-view positioning, so that I can understand exactly how to position myself and my hair for accurate analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the hair analysis photo capture interface THEN the system SHALL display a gallery of example front-view photos showing correct positioning
2. WHEN a user views example images THEN the system SHALL show photos with proper lighting, hair positioning, and camera angles
3. WHEN a user examines the examples THEN the system SHALL highlight key elements like scalp visibility, hair parting, and face positioning
4. IF a user needs more guidance THEN the system SHALL provide annotated examples with visual indicators pointing to important areas

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user taking photos for hair analysis, I want real-time feedback on my photo positioning, so that I can adjust my pose and camera angle before capturing the final image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user activates the camera for photo capture THEN the system SHALL display an overlay guide showing optimal head positioning
2. WHEN a user positions their head in the camera view THEN the system SHALL provide real-time feedback on alignment and positioning
3. WHEN the user's positioning meets quality standards THEN the system SHALL indicate readiness to capture with visual confirmation
4. IF the user's positioning is incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on adjustments needed
5. WHEN lighting conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements or alternative positioning

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with different hair types and lengths, I want to see example images that match my specific hair characteristics, so that I can follow the most relevant guidance for my situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects their hair type THEN the system SHALL display example images specific to that hair type and length
2. WHEN a user has curly or textured hair THEN the system SHALL show examples of proper positioning for maximum scalp visibility
3. WHEN a user has long hair THEN the system SHALL demonstrate how to position hair to show the scalp and hairline clearly
4. IF a user has very short hair THEN the system SHALL provide examples optimized for close scalp analysis
5. WHEN a user has specific concerns (thinning, balding) THEN the system SHALL show targeted examples for those conditions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user concerned about privacy, I want assurance that example images are used appropriately and that my photos will be handled securely, so that I feel comfortable using the hair analysis feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views example images THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that these are anonymized examples used with permission
2. WHEN a user captures their own photos THEN the system SHALL display privacy information about how images are processed and stored
3. WHEN a user completes photo capture THEN the system SHALL provide options for image retention or deletion after analysis
4. IF a user has privacy concerns THEN the system SHALL offer alternative analysis methods that require less detailed imagery

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user on a mobile device with limited bandwidth, I want the photo guide examples to load efficiently, so that I can access guidance without long wait times or excessive data usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the photo guide on mobile THEN the system SHALL load optimized images appropriate for the device and connection speed
2. WHEN a user has slow internet connection THEN the system SHALL provide progressive image loading with low-resolution previews first
3. WHEN a user views multiple example images THEN the system SHALL implement efficient caching to avoid re-downloading
4. IF a user has very limited data THEN the system SHALL offer a text-only guidance mode with minimal image usage
5. WHEN images are loading THEN the system SHALL display clear loading indicators and estimated wait times

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user who struggles with technology, I want simple, clear instructions alongside the visual examples, so that I can successfully capture good quality photos even if I'm not tech-savvy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the photo guide THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step written instructions in simple, clear language
2. WHEN a user follows the photo capture process THEN the system SHALL offer voice guidance or audio instructions as an option
3. WHEN a user makes common mistakes THEN the system SHALL recognize these patterns and provide helpful corrections
4. IF a user needs additional help THEN the system SHALL offer access to video tutorials or live chat support
5. WHEN a user successfully captures a good photo THEN the system SHALL provide positive reinforcement and confirmation
