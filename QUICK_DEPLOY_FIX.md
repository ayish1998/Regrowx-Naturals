## üîç Debug the Deployment Error

### Check These Common Issues:

1. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - Make sure you don't have required env vars that aren't set

2. **Build Errors**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Look for any TypeScript or build errors
   ```

3. **Package.json Issues**
   - Make sure all dependencies are listed
   - Check for version conflicts

4. **Next.js Config**
   - Verify next.config.js is correct

---

## üö® HACKATHON EMERGENCY PLAN

### If All Else Fails:

1. **Use Local Demo**
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Demo from localhost:3000
   - Judges will understand it's a working prototype

2. **Screen Recording**
   - Record your working demo
   - Show the video if live demo fails

3. **Screenshots**
   - Take screenshots of all key features
   - Have them ready as backup

---

## üí° Quick Fixes to Try:

### Fix 1: Update next.config.js

```javascript
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    appDir: true,
  },
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
  },
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true,
  },
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

### Fix 2: Add .vercelignore

```
node_modules
.next
.env.local
```

### Fix 3: Simplify package.json scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

## üéØ WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW:

1. **Try Method 1** (Vercel redeploy)
2. **If that fails, try Method 2** (Netlify)
3. **If both fail, use local demo** with `npm run dev`
