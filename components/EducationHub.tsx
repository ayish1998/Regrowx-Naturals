# Traditional Neem Benefits for Hair Growth

For over 500 years, Ghanaian women have turned to the neem tree as their secret weapon against hair loss and scalp problems. Known locally as "dongoyaro," this remarkable tree has been a cornerstone of traditional African hair care.

## The Ancient Wisdom

Our grandmothers discovered that neem leaves, when boiled and used as a rinse, could:
- **Stimulate hair follicles** and promote new growth
- **Combat dandruff** and scalp infections naturally
- **Strengthen hair roots** to prevent breakage
- **Add natural shine** without harsh chemicals

## Modern Science Confirms Traditional Knowledge

Recent studies have validated what our ancestors knew intuitively. Neem contains:
- **Nimbidin**: A powerful anti-inflammatory compound
- **Quercetin**: An antioxidant that protects hair follicles
- **Essential fatty acids**: That nourish the scalp

## How to Use Neem for Hair Growth

### Traditional Neem Hair Rinse
1. Boil 20-30 fresh neem leaves in 2 cups of water
2. Let it cool and strain the liquid
3. Use as a final rinse after shampooing
4. Massage gently into scalp and leave for 5 minutes
5. Rinse with cool water

### Modern Neem Hair Mask
Combine neem powder with:
- 2 tbsp coconut oil
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 tsp lemon juice

Apply to scalp, leave for 30 minutes, then wash out.

## Community Impact

At Regrowx, we source our neem from women's cooperatives in Northern Ghana, ensuring fair wages and sustainable harvesting. When you use neem-based products, you're supporting 50+ farming families who have preserved this knowledge for generations.

*"My grandmother taught me about neem when I was seven years old. Now I teach my daughter, and through Regrowx, we share this wisdom with the world."* - Akosua Mensah, Traditional Herbalist

# Shea Butter: The Gold of Ghana

In the villages of Northern Ghana, women wake before dawn to begin a process that has remained unchanged for over 1,000 years. They are the keepers of "women's gold" - shea butter, one of Africa's most precious gifts to the world.

## The Sacred Tree

The shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa) is more than just a source of income - it's a sacred part of Ghanaian culture:

## The Traditional Process

Women collect fallen shea nuts, never picking from the tree to ensure sustainability.

### Processing (Year-round)
1. **Cracking**: Nuts are cracked by hand to extract kernels
2. **Roasting**: Kernels are roasted over wood fires
3. **Grinding**: Traditional stone mills crush the kernels
